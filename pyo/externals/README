Welcome to this quick guide for those of you who want to write their 
own pyo objects. These few steps explain how to add custom objects, 
written in C, to the pyo library.

In this folder, there is three self-documented files that can be used 
as a template to build an effect processor (I intend to write examples 
for more object's types in the future). These files can be used as is 
to compile a "Gain" object, which is modifying the volume of a signal 
according to a value, static or audio, given in decibel.

Files are:
    - externalmodule-template.c : C part of the object. Here is defined 
    all the DSP and the python object structure using the Python-C API. 
    It creates an object called "Gain_base".

    - externalmodule-template.h : This file indicates to the "_pyo" 
    module which objects to compile.

    - external-template.py : Python part of the object. Here is defined 
    the user interface of the object. An audio processor is a class that 
    inherits from the PyoObject. In this example, the object is simply 
    called "Gain" and uses "Gain_base" as the real processing part and 
    for multi-channel expansion purpose.

=== Steps to compile the "Gain" objects ===

1. All three files must be copied and renamed respectively:
    - externalmodule.c
    - externalmodule.h
    - external.py

2. Compile pyo with the flag --compile-externals

That's it! The setup.py will add these files to the compilation chain 
and create a "Gain" object in the pyo library.

To add other processing objects, all you have to do is to copy everthing 
about the "Gain" object and then change the name, attributes, methods 
and the processing part according to your new functionnality.

* VERY IMPORTANT *
Only these three files are added to the compilation, so, for the time 
being, all objects MUST be written in those files. Perhaps one day, 
it will be possible to write new objects in separated files but actually, 
it's not possible.
